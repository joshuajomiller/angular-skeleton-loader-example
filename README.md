# Skeload

Smart Skeleton Screens for Angular.

Created by Joshua Miller @ Trax.

This is an example project for the skeload skeleton screen loader. It uses pre-existing views and styles to create the skeleton loading screen, rather than generating new HTML to show the skeleton loading animation.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
